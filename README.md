# Stats, monitoring, and control
================================

Despite the name of this repo, at least in its first three years (2021-2024),
getting stats from an Avalon BTC miner is only one of the things that exists
here.  This collection is a variety of simple tools for monitoring and/or
controlling a variety of gear including crypto miners, power systems, etc.

These are free to use, and I'm happy to get any feedback.  But this is really
just a space for tools I've made for my own use.  No support is stated or
implied.
